  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A software that I personally used that I thought was designed well is Google Drive. I think that Google Drive was 
    designed well because it is clean, organized, and simple for the user to understand. A good software should contain many components 
    in order for it to be considered successful, such as strong functionality, understandable interface and neat aesthetics. Google Drive 
    contains all of these components, with its easily accessible features and well organized layout to create documents, slideshows, 
    and spreadsheets. These well-designed features make Google Drive a staple in my daily school, work, and personal life. Additionally, 
    the success of Google Drive showcases why software design is so important. Software design is key in the production of software because 
    it ensures the efficiency and reliability of the software. Essential components are required in order to make a program user-friendly 
    and structured, and they are implemented by software design. Thus, software design is important because the program relies on the 
    details of the architecture and interfaces in order to be useful and enjoyed by consumers.

    <p>Requirements are a set of operations the program must perform - in the format of clear and concise descriptions of what the client requires for the software. In the requirements gathering stage, there are two types of requirements that the developers must gather. Functional requirements include what the systems should do, and non-functional requirements, which include how the system will perform, constraints, characteristics, system environment. The information will be gathered via interviews, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions involving users and user experiences. The requirement gathering stage is important because it helps the developers understand problems that should be solved by the software, the usersâ€™ needs, and it is the essential foundation for all steps in the software development lifecycle.

    Selected software product: Google Drive
    As a student, I want Google Drive to have a neat and simple user interface, so that I can easily navigate the website.
    As a student, I want to be able to upload and store my school documents (notes, assignments, presentations) in Google Drive, so that I can keep them organized in folders.
    As a team member working on a project, I want to be able to share my documents with others and allow them to edit projects in real-time, so that we could collaborate efficiently for group projects.
    As a mobile user, I want to be able to upload photos and documents directly from my phone, so that I can access them across all my devices.
    As a traveler who requires offline Google Drive access, I want to be able to edit my documents offline, so that I can continue working even when I'm not connected to the internet.

    <h4>Writing Assignment 5</h4>
    <p> The design principle that I want to work on for my assignment is 10. Simplicity. 
      In software design, simplicity is a very important principle that focuses on minimizing complex features and making systems easy to 
      understand and use for both users and developers. It emphasizes clarity, conciseness, and a focus on essential features. This principle is 
      key because it directly impacts the user experience.  Overly complex software can be overwhelming, confusing, and frustrating for users, 
      resulting in an unpleasant experience of the software. One example of simplicity in action is the Google search engine homepage.  It 
      features a clean, straightforward design with a noticeable search bar and minimal distractions. This simplicity allows users to focus on 
      their primary goal: being able to search for information quickly. In contrast, I have noticed that some banking apps have an overly 
      complicated interace, with messy menus, too much information, and a confusing navigation system. Such complexity in a software
      deeply impacts users from completing tasks and navigating the application, which leads to frustration and errors. Especially, for 
      people of older age, they will have a large difficulty utilizing complicated softwares that they require for everyday life, such as 
      banking applications. To simplify the banking app, designers could streamline navigation with clear tabs and a search bar. 
      Information could be presented in clean, labelled sections, with suitable spacing and font sizes. Forms should be clear and 
      easy to access, with labels and helpful prompts, making tasks like transfers and bill payments easier for users of all age groups.
