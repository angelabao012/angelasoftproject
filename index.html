  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A software that I personally used that I thought was designed well is Google Drive. I think that Google Drive was 
    designed well because it is clean, organized, and simple for the user to understand. A good software should contain many components 
    in order for it to be considered successful, such as strong functionality, understandable interface and neat aesthetics. Google Drive 
    contains all of these components, with its easily accessible features and well organized layout to create documents, slideshows, 
    and spreadsheets. These well-designed features make Google Drive a staple in my daily school, work, and personal life. Additionally, 
    the success of Google Drive showcases why software design is so important. Software design is key in the production of software because 
    it ensures the efficiency and reliability of the software. Essential components are required in order to make a program user-friendly 
    and structured, and they are implemented by software design. Thus, software design is important because the program relies on the 
    details of the architecture and interfaces in order to be useful and enjoyed by consumers.
