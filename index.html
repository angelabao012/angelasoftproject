  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A software that I personally used that I thought was designed well is Google Drive. I think that Google Drive was 
    designed well because it is clean, organized, and simple for the user to understand. A good software should contain many components 
    in order for it to be considered successful, such as strong functionality, understandable interface and neat aesthetics. Google Drive 
    contains all of these components, with its easily accessible features and well organized layout to create documents, slideshows, 
    and spreadsheets. These well-designed features make Google Drive a staple in my daily school, work, and personal life. Additionally, 
    the success of Google Drive showcases why software design is so important. Software design is key in the production of software because 
    it ensures the efficiency and reliability of the software. Essential components are required in order to make a program user-friendly 
    and structured, and they are implemented by software design. Thus, software design is important because the program relies on the 
    details of the architecture and interfaces in order to be useful and enjoyed by consumers.

    <h2>Writing Assignment 2</h2>
    <p>Requirements are a set of operations the program must perform - in the format of clear and concise descriptions of what the client requires for the software. In the requirements gathering stage, there are two types of requirements that the developers must gather. Functional requirements include what the systems should do, and non-functional requirements, which include how the system will perform, constraints, characteristics, system environment. The information will be gathered via interviews, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions involving users and user experiences. The requirement gathering stage is important because it helps the developers understand problems that should be solved by the software, the usersâ€™ needs, and it is the essential foundation for all steps in the software development lifecycle.

    Selected software product: Google Drive
    As a student, I want Google Drive to have a neat and simple user interface, so that I can easily navigate the website.
    As a student, I want to be able to upload and store my school documents (notes, assignments, presentations) in Google Drive, so that I can keep them organized in folders.
